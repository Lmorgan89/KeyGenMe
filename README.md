# KeyGenMe Solves
Collection of solutions for KeyGenMe and CrackMes that I've completed


## Tools Used

[**Ghidra**](https://ghidra-sre.org/)

[**OlyDbg**](http://www.ollydbg.de/)

## Why Python?
The majority of my solves are written in python because it's simple to get something that quickly performs the small solve as the majority of the work is done by reversing the binaries and then, once the algorithm is determined, it's simple to write something in python.
For potentially more difficult crackmes, perhapse c++ would be used as it's easier (and a lot nicer) to manipulate bytes and memory.

## This is nice, but there's no writeups?
Writeups will come. But at the moment I'm just learning the super basics of solving these at the moment. Once I'm more comfortable with solving these I'll include writeups for these as a way to go back over things myself.
